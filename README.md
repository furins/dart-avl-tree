`avl_tree` provides  an implementation of am [AVL Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree),
a self-balancing binary search-tree.
 
The implementation is basically a port from the [implementation in Java
by Justin Wheterell](https://code.google.com/p/java-algorithms-implementation/).
 
This implementation provides two custom features usually not present in
AVL trees:
 
1. The methods `add`, `remove`, or `contains` not only accept a value to be
   added, removed, or tested,
   but optionally also a compare function to be used in this very invocation only.
   This comes in handy, if a more efficient compare function can be
   used in a specific invocation. Example: the dynamically changing search
   tree of intersecting line segments in the
   [Bentley-Ottman-Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm).
 
2. The tree can (optionally) store multiple values which are equal with respect
   to the tree ordering, but not identical with respect to Darts `identical()`
   function. One application is again the implementation of the Y-structure
   in the [Bentley-Ottman-Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm),
   where multiple overlapping line segments can be handled as equivalence
   class of line segments stored in one tree node.
 
## Examples
### A balanced tree of ints 

```dart
  // create a tree, and use some methods, use the standard
  // int.compareTo function for ordering
  var tree = new AvlTree<int>();
  tree.addAll([0,1,2]);
  print(tree.inorder.toList());  // -> [0,1,2]
  tree.remove(2);
  print(tree.inorder.toList());  // -> [0,1]
  print(tree.contains(0));       // true
```

### Reverse lexicographic order

Creates balanced tree of strings, ordered in reverse lexicographic order.

```dart
 // a balanced tree of strings, ordered in reverse lexicographical
 // order
 var order = (String s1, String s2) => s2.compareTo(s1);
 var tree = new AvlTree<String>(compare: order);
 tree.addAll(["aaa", "zzz"]);
 print(tree.inorder.toList);     // ["zzz", "aaa"]
```
    
### A tree of strings with equivalence classes

Creates a tree of strings. The order is lexicographic with respect
to the lowercase version of the strings. Strings which are equal
modulo case are in the same equivalence class.

```dart
 lowerCaseCompare(s,t) => s.toLowerCase().compareTo(t.toLowerCase());
 var tree = new AvlTree<String>(compare:lowerCaseCompare,
     withEquivalenceClasses: true);
 tree.addAll(["aaa", "zzz", "AAA"]);
 print(tree.smallest);         // -> ["aaa", "AAA"]
```
